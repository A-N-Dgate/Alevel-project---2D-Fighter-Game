Just thought I should add a little note here :)

the game is most likely complete now, with 3 levels,
music, the pracitce mode and conrols screen fully
complete, the ability to load and save data and 
special moves for 5 of the 6 playable characters.

You should take a bit of time with this one as it
would be cool for you to try to figure out the key 
combinations for 1 or 2 characters, but if that is
taking you too long, then if you look in the 
spritesheets file, you can find the key combinations
there. If you want to test the enemy charcters but 
can't beat a level, load save data with the name
"bom" and all the characters will be unlocked. 

there might be something still wrong with the 
database but its worked for 2 days in a row 
so thats good.

the due date for this project is the 17th (previously,
i thought it was the 24th but oh well) so your feedback
needs to be as soon as possible so I can make the 
adjustments in the final prototype.

thank you for testing and I hope you enjoy this :)
