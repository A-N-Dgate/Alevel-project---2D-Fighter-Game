Hi and thank you for being a tester for my game :)
this is just a quick note about how to play and test


--------------included in this prototype-------------------
You will be greeted with a really basic character select 
screen where you can choose between 3 characters: Goku, 
Trunks or Raditz. To choose a charcter, click somehwere on
the large picture of the character. Then level 1 starts 
where you will have to defeat an unressponsive enemy. After
showing that you have completed the level "You Won" will 
appear on the screen and the program will automatically 
close after a certain amount of time.

This isn't the most smooth running program so don't expect
it to be perfect and it's also pretty small so it won't
take too much time :)

---note if you're using the .exe file:
I honeslty don't know how pyinstaller works so i can't 
really troubleshoot any problems. But int he .exe file
the "You Won" screen and enemy defeated animation isn't
shown and the program ends just after you defeate the 
enemy.

------------------------Controls---------------------------
crouch                                        (down button)
block                                         (z)
move right                                    (right button)
move left                                     (left button)
jump                                          (up button)
                                       
punch                                         (a)
kick                                          (x)
chop                                          (s)
low punch                                     (a + down button)
low kick                                      (x + down button)
low block                                     (z + down button)
uppercut                                      (a + up button)
high kick                                     (x + up button)

note that in this protoype moves which require two key presses 
only work while the character on screen is animating. 
for example:

if you want to do a high kick, press x then while the character
is performing the kick, press x and up one after eachother and 
hopefully after the character has performed the kick, it will
do a high kick.

----------------------feedback----------------------------------
Text me what you thought about it basically and I'll have to 
improve my next prototype based on your suggestions. This will
be inlcuded in the "writeup" for this project, which is the 
protion marked by the exam marker.
