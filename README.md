"# Alevel-project---2D-Fighter-Game" 

This is going to be a full upload of my A-Level Programming project, which is a game using Python and libraries Pygame and SQLite.
Also inluded will be all the prototypes of this project, the final submition document and videos showcasing how testing worked,
referenced in the document.

I want to try and add in Docstring and maybe upload this to GameJolt as a working game, but that would be a while away.
